# Space_Mission_dataset_visualization_using_tableau
This is my very first tableau project. Here the dataset is Space Mission dataset in csv format and the following queries will be search and represented with the visualization tool of tableau.
So the quarries are given below:
1. What are the average temperature details of the Launch sites?
2. What are the average Wind speed details of the Launch sites?
3. What are the average Humidity details of the Launch sites?
4. What are the different varieties of Launch vehicles used by different companies?
5. What is the Mission status of the companies?
6. Track records of the Launch sites.  

The full project is done using only the tableau tool. So, thank you to me to start a very good learning of the visualization tool and I hope I will keep my learning continue to learn more.
